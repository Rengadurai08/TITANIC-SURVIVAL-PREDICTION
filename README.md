**Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to determine patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival. You'll explore how variables like age, gender, and ticket class correlate with survival rates. It's a strong project for learning feature engineering, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
